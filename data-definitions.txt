### Geometry data for the Northern Motorway road segments.

EROAD uses a third party to monitor changes to the road network and provide a
dataset of geometry and attributes such as name, location, road speed. The
dataset we provided you in this file is a subset of our road segments that
include the Northern Motorway, and surrounding roads. We've including associated

### Individual files by machine showing events on and around the Northern Motorway

The Event Dataset consists of 1600 csv files. Each file contains event data for
a single vehicle travelling on or near the Northern Motorway from 16 Nov 2015 to
20 Nov 2015. The events are spaced approximately every 250m, but there may be
some tighter spacing around corners, or around stopped events.

Features:
* id: unique id for each event
* event_timestamp: the exact time the vehicle was in the location. format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.  The time zone is UTC.
* course_over_ground: direction the vehicle was travelling at the time of the event.
* machine_id:  unique identifier for the vehicle
* vehicle_weight_type:  'LIGHT' or 'HEAVY' classification from NZTA. 'HEAVY' vehicles are those with a gross weight of 3.5 tonnes and over.
* speed_gps_kph: speed in Km/h of the vehicle at the time of the event
* latitude: latitude in decimal degrees
* longitude: longitude in decimal degrees
